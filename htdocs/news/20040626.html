    <strong>Development version useful</strong> (26 June 2004)<br/>
    The version in CVS is quite useful. It supports reading
    messages from a named pipe and displaying on screen alerts when
    serious events occur. You can also throttle the number of alert
    dialogs so you're not inundated with error messages.

    Version 0.1 will be released once I've hooked up the Preferences
    dialog (you currently need to edit the config file by hand) and
    written some installation scripts and documentation.
