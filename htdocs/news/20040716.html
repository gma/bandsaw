    <strong>Autoconf/automake support</strong> (16 July 2004)<br/>
    I've been working on autoconf/automake support to make
    installation a breeze. If you'd like to give it a try checkout the
    code from CVS and then run:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr; make install</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback would be much appreciated. I'm going to hold off
    releasing version 0.1 until I've ironed out a couple of minor
    known bugs, but it won't be long now.
