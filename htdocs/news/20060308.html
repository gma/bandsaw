    <strong>0.3.0-dev Development Release</strong> (08 March 2006)<br/>

    It took 18 months to get from 0.1.1 to 0.2.0, and now less than 18
    hours later there's another package. Mmmm, why's that then?
  </p>
  <p>

    There are two problems with 0.2.0. Firstly, I just noticed that it
    has a tendency to ignore some log messages if you get several
    messages arriving at once. 0.1.1 had the same problem, but it's
    now fixed in 0.3.0-dev.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, 0.2.0 hassles you by popping up dialogs all the
    time. Wouldn't it be nice if it caught your eye but let you carry
    on with what you were doing? Possibly with an icon in your
    notification tray?

    You can get it here: <a
    href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bandsaw/bandsaw-0.3.0-dev.tar.gz?download">bandsaw-0.3.0-dev.tar.gz</a>. Hopefully
    it won't be too long before I've updated the user manual and
    rolled out a proper version of 0.3.0...
