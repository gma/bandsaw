    <strong>Band Saw 0.1.1 Released</strong> (02 August 2004)<br/>

    This is a minor release to fix the installation instructions in
    the README file. It suggested that you run <code>make check</code>
    during installation, but it's not necessary and will fail unless
    you have <a href="http://pmock.sourceforge.net/">pMock</a>
    installed.

  <p>
    There's no need to upgrade if you have installed 0.1.0. Packages
    available from the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.
