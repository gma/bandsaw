    <strong>Band Saw 0.3.0 Released</strong> (09 March 2006)<br/>

    The final release of Band Saw 0.3.0 is now available. This is the
    first release that replaces the popup alert dialogs with a nifty
    icon in the notification tray. If you downloaded the development
    release you should still upgrade as I've fixed some UI bugs and
    updated the user manual.
