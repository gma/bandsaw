      <h1>Download</h1>

      <p>
        Band Saw 0.3.0 packages are now available:
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bandsaw/bandsaw-0.3.0.tar.gz?download">bandsaw-0.3.0.tar.gz</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.python.org/2.3/">Python</a> (2.3 or later)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.gtk.org/download/">GTK+</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://pygtk.org/downloads.html">PyGTK and
          gnome-python</a> (a recent release, including
          GnomePythonExtras)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It should run on any operating system that supports GNOME,
        Python and named pipes (otherwise known as FIFOs).
      </p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>

      <p>
        Installation is simple:
      </p>

      <pre>
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ su
        # make install</pre>

      <p>
        Please read the <a
        href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/bandsaw/bandsaw/README">README</a>
        file included with the source code for more details. It is
        important that you <strong>specify the correct prefix when
        configuring the package</strong> or you may find that some
        things don't work correctly on your system (e.g. default
        configuration parameters, installation of the user manual,
        etc.). For example, when installing on my Ubuntu Breezy
        workstation I run the configure command as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc</pre>

      <p>
        For some reason that is beyond me, the GNOME configuration
        daemon doesn't immediately read the default configuration
        settings unless you restart it. I therefore recommend that you
        kill it before running Band Saw for the first time, to ensure
        that it reads the default configuration files that you've just
        installed, like so:
      </p>
      <pre>
        $ killall gconfd-2</pre>
      <p>
        You will only need to kill it once. If anybody can explain how
        this really ought to be handled, I'd much appreciate it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, <em>make sure that you have a notification tray
        running your GNOME panel</em>. You can now run Band Saw either
        from the command line, or using the icon that has been added
        to your GNOME Applications menu. From the command line, just
        type:
      </p>
      <pre>
        $ bandsaw &</pre

      <p>
        I find it helps to run Band Saw from my GNOME session's
        startup programs so that it runs automatically when I log in.
