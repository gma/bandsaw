      <h1>What is Band Saw?</h1>

      <p>
        Band Saw helps system administrators monitor large numbers of
        computers by monitoring <a href="syslog.html">syslog</a> and
        alerting the administrator whenever interesting log messages
        arrive. The administrator has complete control over what
        constitutes an "interesting message".
      </p>

	License</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            
      <p>
	Band Saw is really quite simple; it monitors messages that are
	fed to it from a suitably configured syslog server, looking
	out for messages that contain text that the administrator is
	interested in. Any log message that matches the
	administrator's filters will be brought to the user's
	attention via a dialog box that pops up on screen.
      </p>

      <p>
	Because syslog itself supports propagating messages between
	seperate computers, with syslog and Band Saw you can easily
	monitor a large number of computers for critical errors.
