      <h1>What is Band Saw?</h1>

      <p>
	Band Saw is a <a href="syslog.html">syslog</a> monitoring
	program for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>
	desktop. It allows the user to setup filters that define which
	messages should generate alerts. Combined with syslog's remote
	logging functionality it provides a scalable and easily
	deployed monitoring solution.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Band Saw is released under the terms of the <a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public
	License</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            
      <p>
	Band Saw is really quite simple; it monitors messages that are
	fed to it from a suitably configured syslog server, looking
	out for messages that contain text that the administrator is
	interested in. Any log message that matches the
	administrator's filters will be brought to the user's
	attention via a dialog box that pops up on screen.
      </p>

      <p>
	Because syslog itself supports propagating messages between
	seperate computers, with syslog and Band Saw you can easily
	monitor a large number of computers for critical errors.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Instructions on setting syslog up are included in the
	online help</strong>. Just run Band Saw, open the main window,
	and press F1.
      </p>
