For 0.3.1 (focus on incremental UI improvements):

- Fix bug 1364795.

- Add a menu to the notification icon, accessed with a right click.

- Don't quit when closing the log window.

- Remove the drop down menu from the search tools.

- Stop notification icon flashing when log window is focused.

- Use gconf to remember the last window position at startup.

For 0.4.0 (focus on improved filtering):

- Creation of filters used to ignore messageas.

- Either make it more obvious that when a message matches a filter
  processing is stopped, or allow each filter to control whether or
  not it brings an end to processing.

For later releases:

- Re-open pipe when path changed, checking for IOErrors.

- Fix auto scrolling performance issues.
