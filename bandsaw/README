About Band Saw
==============

Band Saw is a syslog monitoring program desgined to help system
administrators monitor many computers simultaneously. It runs on the
desktop, displaying alerts when important log messages are received.

Requirements
============

Band Saw is a GNOME application, written in Python. You will need to
have GNOME, Python and the PyGTK and gnome-python libraries installed
in order to run it. You will also need a syslog server.

Though Band Saw has only been tested on Linux it should run on other
Unix like operating systems without modification (feedback would be
appreciated).

GNOME, Python and PyGTK are available pre-packaged with most Linux
distributions. Alternatively they may be obtained from the following
sites:

  http://www.gnome.org/
  http://www.python.org/
  http://pygtk.org/

If you are unsure if you have the necessary software try running the
configure script (see below); it will inform you if you are missing
any of the required dependencies.

Installation
============

The installation scripts are explained in detail in the INSTALL file,
but for most users the following should suffice:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
  $ make
  # make install

You should change the /usr prefix to match the path where your GNOME
installation has been installed. The sysconfdir parameter should point
to your gconf configuration files (e.g. /etc/gconf). If either path is
incorrect you may find that the user manual and default configuration
options are unavailable.

Support
=======

Check the Band Saw user manual for help configuring Band Saw once it
is installed (choose Help->Contents from within Band Saw, or open the
GNOME help browser and navigate to the Band Saw Manual).

If you have any problems using Band Saw please post a message to the
Band Saw forum, describing your problem:
